# flagthing

A little tool that helps design flags that consist of equally sized parallel bands.

Flags can be shared through the link generated below, which opens Flagthing, or downloaded in svg format.

Flagthing uses Vue 3.

## Examples

- [Non-binary flag](https://flagthing.glitch.me/?c=_FFF430+_FFFFFF+_9C59D1+_000000&b=0+1+2+3)
- [Using only named web colors](https://flagthing.glitch.me/?c=black+green+beige+darkred&b=3+1+2+0+3)
- [Mirrored flag](https://flagthing.glitch.me/?c=_000000+_44aa44+_ffdd88+_ffffff+_880000&b=0+4+2+1+3+1+2+4+0)
- [https://flagthing.glitch.me/?c=_000000+_0aaaa0+_ffaa00&b=0+1+0+2+1+0+2+0](https://flagthing.glitch.me/?c=_000000+_0aaaa0+_ffaa00&b=0+1+0+2+1+0+2+0)

## To do

- Convert from svg to other image formats for download.
- Allow moving colors. Swapping them could lead to interesting results.
  - Undo/redo system for colors as well?
